			<p>We are located in Chicago's southside Bronzeville neighborhood.  
			Bronzeville borders begin at 35th Street from the North to 51st Street
			to the South and from I-94 on the West, to Cottage Grove and Drexel on the East. 
			In the early 20th century, Bronzeville was known as the "Black Metropolis," 
			one of the nation's most significant landmarks of African-American urban history. 
			Between 1910 and 1920, the population of the area increased dramatically when 
			thousands of African-Americans fled the oppression of the south and emigrated 
			to Chicago in search of industrial jobs. 
			</p>
			<p>
			There were many famous people associated with the development of the neighborhood including:
			 Andrew "Rube" Foster, founder of the Negro National Baseball League; Ida B. Wells, 
			 civil rights activist, journalist and organizer of the NAACP; Margaret Taylor-Burroughs, 
			 noted artist, author, and one of the co-founders of the DuSable Museum of African 
			 American History; Bessie Coleman, the first African-American woman pilot; Gwendolyn Brooks, 
			 famous author and first African-American recipient of the Pulitzer Prize, 
			 actress Marla Gibbs, legendary singers Sam Cooke and Lou Rawls; and Louis Armstrong, the 
			 legendary trumpet player and bandleader who performed at many of the area's night clubs. 
			</p>

			<p>After the Great Depression hit, the affluent neighborhood, that was once Chicago's
				Harlem Renaissance, suffered tremendously.  But community-driven revitalization efforts
				have been put in place to bring the neighborhood back to its glory.  Historic clubs have
				reopened and in addition to that, art galleries, coffee shops and restaurants have opened up as well.
